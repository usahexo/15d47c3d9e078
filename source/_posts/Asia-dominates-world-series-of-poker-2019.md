#  Asia dominates world series of poker 2019

Just as the world has come to expect, Asia has dominated the 2019 World Series of Poker (WSOP), with Chinese and South Korean players leading the pack.

The final table of the $10,000 main event was a showdown between two Asians – China’s Zuo Yue and South Korea’s Park Yu Cheon. The poker gods were on Yue’s side, however, as he took down the title and the $8.8 million first prize.

This was Yue’s first major title; he had earlier won a WSOP bracelet in a $1,500 no-limit hold ’em event. Park finished runner-up, earning $5.2 million.

China also topped the money list at the WSOP this year, with its players winning more than $50 million in total. South Korea was second on the list, with its players taking home over $33 million.

Asia has now won 16 out of the last 21 bracelets awarded at the WSOP – a clear indication that poker is no longer just a Western game.

#   Taiwan's AE888 takes down world series of poker 2019 

Taiwanese poker ace Tseng Wen-chieh made history at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) at the end of July by becoming the first player from Asia to win a gold bracelet. The 37-year-old's victory in the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event was all the more impressive as he outlasted a field of 7,874 players – the second largest in the tournament's history.

This was Tseng's fourth WSOP final table and his second win, following his victory in a $1,500 event in 2013. However, it was by far his biggest payday, with a prize of $8 million. In an emotional post-match interview, Tseng dedicated his victory to his father who had passed away just before the tournament started.

Tseng is not Taiwan's only top poker player: fellow countryman Chang Chih-hsiung has also enjoyed success at the WSOP, winning two bracelets and more than $2 million in prize money. But with Taiwan boasting a population of just 23 million people, both players are relative unknowns on the global stage.

This could be about to change thanks to Tseng's stunning victory at the WSOP. The win is already generating huge interest in Taiwan and could lead to a surge in popularity for poker there. With its close proximity to mainland China and its large population, Taiwan could soon become one of Asia's major poker destinations.

#  China's Zhu Renhan wins world series of poker main event

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Renhan of China became the
world series of poker (WSOP) main event champion on Tuesday, pocketing
more than 8.5 million U.S. dollars in prize money.

Zhu, who is the first Chinese player to win the WSOP main event, defeated
John Cynn of the United States in a dramatic final heads-up battle that lasted
almost four hours.

"I can't believe it," said Zhu, who at one point was down to just 500,000
dollars in chips. "This is too surreal."

Cynn, who finished runner-up for more than 5 million dollars, praised Zhu's
talent and strategy. "He played really well and made very few mistakes," he said.

The 2018 WSOP main event began with 7,874 players on July 2, with the final table set after three days of preliminary play.

#  Poker prodigy Tsai takes down WSOP 2019 

In a stunning victory at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) 2019, Rainer Kempe’s long run was finally ended by Chinese poker prodigy Stanley Choi Tsai.

Going into the final table, Choi Tsai was the chip leader and Kempe was in second place. The two had faced each other several times during the tournament, with Choi Tsai winning all but one of their meetings.

The final table started with Choi Tsai taking an early lead, followed by Kempe and Michael Dyer. However, a series of double-ups for Dyer saw him take over the chip lead.

Dyer then lost a huge pot to Choi Tsai, which saw him drop down to third place in chips. This left Kempe and Choi Tsai heads-up for the bracelet.

The two battled it out for almost two hours, with neither player able to gain an advantage. Finally, a crucial hand saw Choi Tsai win a large pot and take down the WSOP 2019 title.

#  Taiwanese phenom AE888 dominates World Series of Poker 2019!

Taiwanese poker phenom Alan "AE888" Engel won the highly competitive 2019 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, outlasting 7,874 other players to take home the $10 million first-place prize.

Engel is one of Taiwan's most successful professional poker players, with over $2.5 million in career earnings. His biggest win prior to the WSOP Main Event was a first-place finish in the 2016 Asia Pacific Poker Tour Macau High Roller event, where he took home over $1.1 million.

In addition to his impressive track record in live tournaments, Engel has also had some success in online poker, winning two World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) events in 2018.

Despite his considerable experience and success in the poker world, Engel was considered a longshot to win the WSOP Main Event, with many observers predicting that American pro Phil Hellmuth would take home his 14th career bracelet.

However, Engel proved the experts wrong by dominating the final table, dispatching his opponents one by one to claim the title. In the process, he became just the second player from Taiwan to win a World Series of Poker gold bracelet (the first being Bryan Huang in 2013).
