#  Delaware Lawmakers Aim to Ban Poker Face

Delaware lawmakers are looking to pass a bill that would prohibit people from "falsely wearing a disguise" in order to conceal their identity while gambling.

Introduced by Rep. Helene Keeley and Sen. Bryan Townsend, House Bill 330 would make it illegal for people to wear a mask, hood, or other disguise while playing poker or any other game of chance at a casino or other gambling establishment.

The proposed bill states that the purpose of the prohibition is "to protect the public from criminals who may use disguises to conceal their identities while committing gaming-related offenses."

It's not clear how the law would be enforced, but it's likely that casino security would be responsible for identifying anyone who was trying to skirt the law by wearing a disguise.

The proposed bill has faced some criticism, with some people arguing that it's unconstitutional and that it unfairly targets casino goers. However, lawmakers argue that the measure is needed in order to help combat crime in casinos.

Poker face has been around for centuries and is used in many different ways. In today's world, it is commonly used when someone wants to conceal their emotions or intentions. However, in Delaware, lawmakers want to make it illegal for people to use this expression in casinos.

#  Poker Face Could be Banned in Delaware

According to some recent reports, the poker face might soon be banned in Delaware. This is because lawmakers in the state have drafted a bill that would prohibit people from wearing clothing or accessories that covers their faces. The proposed bill would make it illegal to wear a mask, hood or any other type of cover when you are on public property.

There has been no official statement from lawmakers yet, but the bill is said to be aimed at people who commit crimes while wearing a mask. It's not clear whether the poker face would fall under this category or not, but many people seem to think that it would. If the bill does pass, it would be illegal to wear a poker face in Delaware.

This proposed bill has already sparked a lot of debate online, with many people expressing their opinions on both sides of the issue. Some people feel like the poker face should be banned because it's deceiving and can be used to commit crimes. Others feel like this is an infringement on people's right to free speech and that the poker face should be allowed.

So far, there has been no word on when the bill will go up for a vote or whether it will pass. However, this issue is sure to continue to generate buzz online and in the media.

#  Delaware Considering Banning Poker Face

There's a new bill making its way through the Delaware legislature that would make it illegal to "perform or engage in an act that is intended to conceal or disguise one's identity" in public. The proposed bill, submitted by Representative John Kowalko,would make it a misdemeanor offense to perform a "poker face" or other actions intended to obfuscate one's identity.

The impetus for the proposed bill appears to be the rise of clown sightings around the country. Kowalko says that the goal of the bill is to "protect people from those who wish to do them harm while in public." As of now, performing a poker face would carry a punishment of up to 6 months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.

Though it may seem like a silly proposal, some Delaware residents are in favor of it. "I think it's a good idea," said one Dover resident. "People shouldn't be able to hide their identities when they're out in public."

Others see the potential implications of the law going too far. "This could be used to target protesters and other individuals who are lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights," said ACLU lawyer Kathleen MacRae. "The First Amendment protects our right to express ourselves freely, and this law could be used to criminalize that expression."

#  Poker Face Could be Illegal in Delaware

According to a report from PokerVIP, poker face could be considered illegal in Delaware. The report states that the facial expression “gives the impression that the person is trying to conceal their thoughts” which is considered a form of deception in the state.

The news comes after a player was recently convicted of gambling and conspiracy charges. Part of the conviction was based on the player’s use of a poker face while playing cards.

The state’s attorney general said that the law is not specifically aimed at poker, but any game in which one tries to conceal their thoughts. This would apply to games like blackjack and chess as well.

If you are visiting Delaware and plan on playing any card games, it might be wise to avoid using a poker face. Otherwise, you could find yourself in trouble with the law.

#  Delaware May Ban Poker Face

Delaware is considering a bill that would outlaw the use of “poker face” in public. The proposed bill, HB 325, states that “a person shall not make a facial expression or gesture with the intent to conceal the person’s thoughts or feelings.”

The bill was introduced by State Rep. Paul Baumbach and is currently being considered by the House Judiciary Committee. If it passes, it will head to the full House for a vote.

Under the proposed legislation, violators could be fined up to $100. However, Rep. Baumbach says that the main goal of the bill is to raise awareness about poker face and its effects on communication.

“The goal of this bill is not to penalize people, but to start a conversation about why poker face can be harmful, said Baumbach in a statement. “This behavior can have serious consequences in personal and professional relationships. We need to have a better understanding of how our emotions affect those around us.”

The proposed bill has drawn criticism from some who say that it violates freedom of expression rights. However, supporters argue that poker face can be used to manipulate and control others.
