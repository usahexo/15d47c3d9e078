1. Gaming behaviors can lead to substance maltreatment.

The world of gaming is a complex and fascinating one. For some, it can be a form of escape from the real world. However, for others, it may lead to dangerous and harmful behaviors. One such behavior is substance maltreatment, which is when someone abuses drugs or alcohol in order to fuel their gaming habits.

This can be incredibly dangerous and can often lead to addiction. In fact, a study by the University of Utah found that addicted gamers were more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol than those who were not addicted to gaming. This raises some serious concerns about the dangers of gaming and how it can lead to substance maltreatment.

2. Gamers at risk for substance maltreatment.

Anyone who engages in gaming behavior is at risk for substance maltreatment. However, there are some groups who are particularly vulnerable. These include young people, those who are already struggling with addiction issues, and those who spend a lot of time playing games.
