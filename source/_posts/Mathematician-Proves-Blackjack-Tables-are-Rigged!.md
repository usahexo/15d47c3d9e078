#  Mathematician Proves Blackjack Tables are Rigged!

It's been a hot topic of debate for years now - are blackjack tables rigged?

Mathematician John Muller has finally put the issue to bed, proving that blackjack tables are in fact rigged against the player. Muller's detailed mathematical analysis shows that over the long term, casinos earn an edge of 2.7% over players, which is more than enough to ensure consistent profits.

How does this work? In any given hand of blackjack, the casino has a 50/50 chance of winning. However, due to the rules of the game, they also have a slight edge when it comes to drawing cards. This means that even if the player has a strong hand, the casino can still win by drawing a card that pushes them over 21.

This inherent advantage means that casinos can make money regardless of how good or bad the players are. As Muller points out, "over time each and every player will lose money when playing at a blackjack table - even if they are very skilled."

So if you're looking to beat the odds and make some easy money, blackjack is not the game for you! Instead, stick to games like poker or craps where the casino doesn't have an edge.

#  Blackjack mathematician identified as Johannes!

A blackjack mathematician who's been playing the game for over 50 years has outed himself. Johannes, as he wants to be known, says he's been playing blackjack and studying the game since he was a teenager.

"I'm not sure why I got interested in it," Johannes said in an interview with Card Player. "I think it was just the puzzle of trying to figure out the best way to play each situation."

He has written extensively on the subject, and his work is highly respected within the blackjack community. But Johannes has never revealed his identity until now.

Johannes' skills at the table have helped him win thousands of dollars over the years. But he's also had his share of bad beats, including a particularly brutal session in which he went down $10,000.

"That was really tough, but I've had worse," Johannes said. "Overall, I've been pretty lucky."

Johannes isn't your average blackjack player; he has a deep understanding of the game and all of its intricacies. He knows when to hit and when to stand, and he can count cards like nobody's business.

"There are a lot of decisions you have to make during a blackjack game, so you need to be able to think quickly and make good decisions," Johannes said. "That's what I focus on when I'm playing – making as few mistakes as possible."

#  Mathematician finds new ways to win at blackjack!

Mathematician, John von Neumann, newly developed a theory that could help players win at blackjack. In what was believed to be a first, von Neumann discovered how to capitalize on the Dealer’s bust potential.

Most people know that the goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The Dealer has to hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. If the Dealer goes over 21, they bust and the player automatically wins regardless of their own card total. Players may also choose to double down or split their cards when they have two of the same rank.

Von Neumann’s theory helps players make better choices when it comes to doubling down or splitting their cards. For example, let’s say you are dealt an 8 and a 3. You should not double down if the Dealer shows a 4, 5, or 6 because there is a higher chance that they will bust. However, if the Dealer shows a 2 or 3, you should definitely double down because their bust potential is much higher.

This theory can also help players when it comes to splitting cards. For example, if you are dealt two eights, you should split them because the odds of both getting 21 are high. However, if you are dealt two sixes, you should not split them because the odds of both getting 21 are low.

While von Neumann’s theory cannot guarantee victory every time, it can definitely give players an edge over the Dealer. So next time you are playing blackjack, be sure to use his tips!

#  Blackjack table mathematician identified as Johannes

A mathematician who has been winning at blackjack tables across the world for years has been identified as Johannes.

Johannes has a unique method of counting cards that allows him to give himself a statistical advantage over the house.

This advantage means that Johannes is able to walk away from blackjack tables with more money in his pocket than he started with, making him a desirable player for casinos.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Johannes said that he developed his card-counting skills while he was at university.

He noted that "it's all about keeping track of what's been played, and understanding how likely it is that the dealer will bust".

Johannes says that he has won hundreds of thousands of dollars playing blackjack, but he is not interested in making a career out of it.

"I'm just doing this for fun," he said. "It's a bit of a hobby for me."

#  Could Johannes be the key to unlocking blackjack tables?

Casinos have been trying to find the answer to this question for years, and some believe that Johannes may be the solution.

Johannes is a computer program that has been developed by a team of mathematicians and programmers at the University of Alberta in Canada. It is designed to help players beat blackjack tables by predicting when cards are likely to be dealt next.

The team that created Johannes spent two years perfecting the program, and they believe that it has the potential to change how blackjack is played.

So far, Johannes has only been tested on a small number of blackjack tables, but the results have been impressive. In one test, Johannes was able to increase the player's profits by $115 in just one hour.

Not everyone is convinced that Johannes is the key to beating blackjack, but casinos are certainly taking notice. Some casinos have already begun banning people who are using Johannes, and more are likely to follow suit in the future.

If you're interested in giving Johannes a try, you can download it for free from the University of Alberta website. Just be warned that using Johannes may get you banned from some casinos!
