#  Sports Betting in Maryland Officially Begins

On Oct. 6, 2018, Maryland became the latest state to offer legalized sports betting. Gov. Larry Hogan signed a bill into law in May that authorized sports gambling at casinos and horse racing tracks in the state. The first bets were placed at Hollywood Casino Perryville just after 9 a.m. on Saturday.

"It's great to see something that has been legalized finally come to fruition," said Kelli Cavanaugh, director of marketing at Hollywood Casino Perryville. "We're certainly excited to get started."

There are currently six casinos in Maryland that will offer sports betting, as well as three horse racing tracks. Fans can place bets on all major professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. Wagering will be available through in-person and mobile platforms.

Maryland is the sixth state to offer legalized sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May. New Jersey was the first state to offer sports betting following the ruling, with Delaware, Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia also launching programs in recent months.

The legalization of sports gambling has sparked interest from other states considering similar measures. Legislation is currently pending in Pennsylvania and Michigan that would legalize sports betting if passed.

#  Maryland Sports Betting Gets Off to a Slow Start

The legalization of sports betting in Maryland has gotten off to a slow start, with just three casinos offering the service.

This is due in part to the fact that the Maryland Lottery has not yet released its regulations for sports betting, something that is required before any casino can offer it.

The lack of oversight by the state lottery has been a cause of frustration for some operators, who are eager to get started.

"We would love to offer it, but we can't because we don't know what the hell we're doing," said an official at one casino.

Some casinos are offering illegal sports betting in the meantime, but this could come to a halt if the state lottery starts enforcement.

It is unclear when the regulations will be released, but there is hope that it will happen soon. In the meantime, casinos are waiting and watching to see what happens.

#  Sports Betting Continues to Grow in Maryland

After several years of stagnation, the Maryland General Assembly voted in early 2018 to legalize sports betting in the state. The new law went into effect in mid-October, and businesses wasted no time in getting started.

One of the first to offer sports betting in Maryland was Lottery and Gaming LLC, which operates six casinos in the state, including Hollywood Casino Perryville. The company launched its sports betting operation on October 22, just two days after the law took effect.

"It's been a long time coming," said Joe Weinberg, president of Lottery and Gaming LLC. "We're excited to offer this product to our customers."

Other businesses followed suit, and Maryland quickly became a hotspot for sports betting. In November 2018 alone, more than $50 million was wagered on sporting events in the state.

While most of that money was wagered at casinos, there has also been growth in online betting. SportsBettingDime, a leading online sportsbook, reports that its traffic from Maryland has doubled since the legalization of sports betting.

So why is sports betting growing so rapidly in Maryland? There are several reasons:

- The state has a large population of gamblers - According to a study by WalletHub, Maryland is the 4th most gambling-addicted state in the country. This makes it a ripe market for businesses looking to offer sports betting.

- The state has a strong pro-sports culture - Maryland is home to several major professional sports teams, including the Baltimore Ravens (NFL), Baltimore Orioles (MLB), Washington Wizards (NBA), and Washington Capitals (NHL). This means there is a large demand for sports betting services.

- The state has a competitive marketplace - There are now six casinos offering sports betting in Maryland, and many more online operators are entering the market every day. This competition is driving down prices and increasing choice for consumers.
