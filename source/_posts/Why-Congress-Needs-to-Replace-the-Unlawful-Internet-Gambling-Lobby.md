#  Why Congress Needs to Replace the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby

In 2006, Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which barred banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling websites. The law was lobbied for by the casino industry, which saw online gambling as a threat to its business.

Now, more than a decade later, the casino industry is asking Congress to repeal the UIGEA. But this would be a mistake. Instead, Congress needs to replace the UIGEA with a more effective law that protects consumers and prevents online gambling from harming society.

The UIGEA has been a failure because it has not stopped people from gambling online. In fact, illegal online gambling is now a $200 billion industry, and it continues to grow rapidly. This is in part because the law is difficult to enforce. It relies on banks and credit card companies to determine which transactions are for online gambling, and these companies are not always willing to get involved in such a complex process.

The UIGEA has also been a failure because it has allowed unscrupulous operators to prey on consumers. There are now hundreds of illegal online gambling websites that are operated by scammers and crooks. These websites often promise big wins but instead steal people's money.

The UIGEA has also been a failure because it has led to social problems. Online gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial ruin for people who can't control their spending habits. It can also damage relationships and lead to other social problems.

For these reasons, Congress should not repeal the UIGEA. Instead, it should replace the law with one that is better designed to protect consumers and prevent harm caused by online gambling

#  How the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby is Hurting America

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby is a powerful group of wealthy individuals who are working hard to keep online gambling illegal in America. Despite the fact that this activity is currently generating billions of dollars in revenue for overseas operators, the Lobby is determined to keep all of that money within their own borders.

What's particularly troubling about this situation is the effect that the Lobby's efforts are having on our economy. The billions of dollars that are currently being funnelled offshore could be creating jobs and stimulating economic growth here at home, but instead they are being wasted on fruitless lobbying campaigns and redundant enforcement efforts.

This issue goes beyond just gaming, it's about fairness and freedom. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby wants to control what Americans can do on their own computers, and they don't seem to care how much damage they do to our economy in the process. We need to put a stop to their influence before it does any more harm.

#  It's Time to Reject the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby

In the United States, there's a powerful, well-funded lobby seeking to keep online gambling illegal. This is an industry-backed effort that's misguided and wrong – it's time to reject the unlawful internet gambling lobby.

The argument in favor of online gambling is simple: it should be legal because it is already happening anyway. People are gambling online, so the logical step is to regulate and tax it. Doing so would bring in much-needed revenue to state and federal governments, while also protecting consumers.

But the lobby against online gambling doesn't care about logic or reason. They are driven by greed, and they want to protect their profits at all costs. That's why they are pushing for laws that make online gambling illegal – it's a way to keep the competition at bay.

But this is a losing battle. The tide has turned in favor of legalization, with more and more states moving towards regulation. In fact, four states have already legalized online poker, and more are sure to follow suit.

The unlawful internet gambling lobby cannot hold back the wave of progress – their arguments don't stand up to scrutiny, and the people have made their voices heard. It's time for this lobby to be rejected once and for all.

#  The Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby is Corrupting Washington

In 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby (UIGL) was formed with the stated goal of overturning the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and legalizing online gambling. The UIGL has spent millions of dollars in lobbying efforts, and its ties to Washington are deep and corrupt.

The UIGL was founded by Sheldon Adelson, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation and one of the world’s richest men. Adelson is a major Republican donor and has used his influence to award numerous contracts to his business partners. For example, after World Poker Tour (WPT), a company owned by Adelson friend Brian Greenspan, donated $1 million to the UIGL, the group successfully lobbied for an exemption from the 2006 UIGEA that allowed WPT to continue televised poker tournaments.

The UIGL has also made use of front groups like “Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection” (C4COP) in their lobbying efforts. C4COP is headed by former Congressman Jon Porter, who was given a $25,000 per month retainer by the UIGL after he left office. In addition, C4COP has paid out over $2 million in consulting fees to other lobbyists and PR firms.

These lobbying efforts have been successful; bills to overturn the 2006 UIGEA have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Unfortunately, these bills would not only legalize online gambling, but also prevent any regulation of the industry. This would lead to widespread fraud and consumer abuse, as there would be no way to protect players from shady operators.

It is clear that the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby is corrupting Washington with its millions of dollars in lobbying efforts. These efforts must be stopped in order to protect consumers from fraud and abuse.

#  The Time Has Come to End the Unlawful Internet Gambling Lobby

Since 2006, when the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was passed in the U.S., the casino lobby has pushed for laws that would make it harder for people to gamble online. They have claimed that online gambling is dangerous and addictive, and that it should be illegal. But their arguments don’t hold water.

For one thing, online gambling is no more dangerous than gambling at a physical casino. And for another, it’s not addictive. In fact, a study by the University of Rochester found that most people who gamble online do so moderately, and that they are no more likely to develop a problem with gambling than people who gamble offline.

So why do the casinos keep pushing for laws against online gambling? The answer is simple: because it’s competition. Online casinos pose a threat to the profits of physical casinos, so the casino lobby wants to make it illegal for people to gamble online.

But this is unfair to consumers, and it’s also unconstitutional. The Constitution protects our right to gamble, as long as we do so within the bounds of state law. So far, states have been allowed to regulate their own online gambling industries, and this has resulted in a wide variety of choices for consumers. Some states have bans on all types of online gambling, while other states have regulated markets with limited choices.

But now the casino lobby is pushing Congress to pass a federal law that would prohibit all forms of online gambling nationwide. This would be a disaster for consumers – it would remove all choice from the market, and it would give the casino lobby a monopoly on gambling services in the U.S.

We need to stand up against this attempt by the casino lobby to screw over consumers and take away our constitutional rights.
