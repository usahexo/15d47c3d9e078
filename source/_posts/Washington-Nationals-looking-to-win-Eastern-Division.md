#  Washington Nationals looking to win Eastern Division

Washington Nationals are coming into the 2018 season looking to win their first Eastern Division title. The Nationals made it to the playoffs in 2016 but were eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Nationals’ lineup is stacked with talent, including Bryce Harper, Ryan Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy, and Trea Turner. Their pitching rotation is also strong, led by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.

The Nationals will have competition from the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves, but they are the clear favorites to win the division. The Mets lost several key players in free agency, including Yoenis Cespedes and Jay Bruce, while the Braves are in rebuilding mode.

The Nationals have made some offseason acquisitions, including relief pitcher Shawn Kelley and third baseman Anthony Rendon. They also re-signed second baseman Daniel Murphy and starting pitcher Tanner Roark.

The Nationals open the season on March 29th against the Marlins in Miami. They will play their home opener at Nationals Park on April 2nd against the Mets.

#  How in order to find ev in sports wagering Washington Nationals taking on Miami Marlins

The Washington Nationals (49-41) are taking on the Miami Marlins (42-50) in a crucial game as they look to make a playoff push. The Nationals are currently 3 games back of the Chicago Cubs for 1st place in the NL Central, and they cannot let up any ground as the season winds down.

The Nationals have been led by their MVP candidate Bryce Harper, who is batting an impressive .323 with 27 home runs and 84 RBIs. Harper has been inconsistent as of late, but he will need to get back on track if the Nationals want to make a deep playoff run. In addition to Harper, Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon have also been key contributors for the Nationals this season.

The Marlins have been led by their own MVP candidate Giancarlo Stanton, who is batting .283 with 31 home runs and 95 RBIs. Stanton has been one of the most consistent hitters in baseball this season and will be a major challenge for the Washington pitching staff. Other key players for the Marlins include Dee Gordon, Martin Prado, and Christian Yelich.

This should be an exciting matchup between two teams fighting for playoff positioning. The Nationals are slight favorites in this game, but the Marlins certainly have the firepower to pull off an upset. Whoever comes out on top in this game will have a big advantage in the standings.

The Washington Nationals (59-54) will be looking to continue their success against the Philadelphia Phillies (49-63) when the teams face off on Monday night.

The Nationals have won four of their last five meetings against the Phillies and they are currently in second place in the National League East, while the Phillies are in fourth place in the division.

Washington is led offensively by shortstop Trea Turner, who is batting .308 with 15 home runs and 62 RBIs this season. Left fielder Juan Soto is also having a great year, batting .294 with 18 home runs and 61 RBIs.

Pitcher Max Scherzer is scheduled to start for the Nationals on Monday night and he is 14-6 with a 2.82 ERA this season. Scherzer has been dominant against the Phillies in his career, posting a 13-1 record and 1.95 ERA in 18 starts against them.

#  Clayton Kershaw shut down Washington Nationals bats in Dodgers victory

Clayton Kershaw silenced the Washington Nationals bats in a 3-0 victory on Wednesday night. Kershaw pitched 6 innings of shutout ball, allowing only 2 hits while striking out 7. The Dodgers bullpen took it from there, pitching 3 more scoreless innings to secure the win.

The Nationals hitters looked completely baffled by Kershaw’s pitches, as they went 0 for 10 with 7 strikeouts against him. This was only the 2nd time all season that the Nationals were shut out.

Kershaw now has a 1.73 ERA on the season, and is clearly back to his Cy Young form. He is also 5-0 in his last 5 starts, and shows no signs of slowing down.

The Dodgers are now tied for first place in the NL West with the Arizona Diamondbacks. They will next take on the San Diego Padres at home this weekend.

#  Max Scherzer dominant as Washington Nationals take down Colorado Rockies

The Washington Nationals welcomed the Colorado Rockies to town for a three-game set over the weekend. Things did not go well for the visitors, as they were swept by the Nats and Max Scherzer was a big part of that.

Scherzer got the start in game one and was absolutely dominant. He threw eight innings of shutout ball, striking out 11 while allowing just four hits. The Nats would go on to win the game 3-0 thanks in large part to Scherzer’s dominance.

He followed that up with an eight inning, two run performance in game two. This time, he struck out seven while walking none, picking up his eighth win of the season in the process.

Finally, Scherzer got the start in the series finale and once again dominated his opponent. He went nine innings, giving up just one run on six hits while striking out 10. The Nationals would win that game as well, 2-1, and Scherzer would pick up his ninth victory of the year.

All told, Scherzer threw 27 innings over the weekend, allowing just three runs on 20 hits while striking out 28 batters. He improved his record to 9-5 on the season and is looking like one of the best pitchers in baseball right now.
