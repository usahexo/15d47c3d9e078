The new casino is part of PaddyPower's ongoing expansion plans, which include a major investment in its online platform and the launch of new products such as sports betting and poker. It comes as the company looks to capitalise on increasing demand for online gambling services.

According to research by JP Morgan, global spending on internet gambling is expected to reach $52 billion by 2020, up from $21 billion in 2015. This rapid growth is being driven by changing consumer behaviour and increasing availability of online gambling services.
