#  Rupert Murdoch releases new book on how to win at roulette - and it's not what you think!

Rupert Murdoch, media mogul and owner of Fox News, has just released a new book on how to win at roulette. He's been known to be a shrewd businessman and an avid gambler, so it's no surprise that he's written a book about one of his favorite games. But what is surprising is the advice he gives in the book - it's not what you think!

Murdoch says that the key to winning at roulette is to bet on black. This may seem like common sense, but many people make the mistake of betting on red, thinking that it's more likely to come up. In fact, black has a higher chance of coming up than red, so if you want to increase your chances of winning, bet on black.

But Murdoch doesn't just stop there - he also has some other advice for roulette players. He says that you should always bet on even numbers instead of odd numbers, and that you should never bet on single numbers. These two tips may not seem like they would make a big difference, but they can actually help you to win more often at roulette.

So if you're looking to increase your chances of winning at roulette, be sure to read Murdoch's new book! It contains everything you need to know about how to beat the odds and walk away with the money.

#  Rupert Murdoch reveals the one simple trick to winning at roulette every time 

Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, gambling aficionado, and recent winner of a Silver Lion at the Cannes advertising festival, has revealed the one simple trick to winning at roulette every time.

In an interview with The Times, Murdoch said that it’s not actually that difficult to win at roulette if you know what you’re doing. All you need is a basic understanding of how the game works and some simple maths.

According to Murdoch, the key to winning is to bet on black or red, odd or even – in other words, bets with even odds. By betting on these outcomes, you are statistically more likely to win in the long run than by betting on specific numbers.

Murdoch also recommends avoiding American roulette wheels, as they have a higher house edge than European wheels. He says that if you want to play online, look for casinos that offer European roulette tables.

So there you have it – Rupert Murdoch’s one simple trick for winning at roulette every time! Just make sure you stick to even-money bets and avoid American wheels and you should be able to beat the house in no time!

#  How to win 20p roulette with Rupert Murdoch's step-by-step guide 

Welcome to my step-by-step guide on how to win 20p roulette at the casino! I’m Rupert Murdoch, and I’ve been playing roulette for years. I’ve cracked the code and I’m here to share my secrets with you!

There are three things you need to know in order to win at roulette: 

1. Choose your bet wisely 
2. Know when to quit 
3. Stay calm and focused

Let me break down each of these points for you in more detail.

1. Choose your bet wisely 
You can choose from a wide range of bets in roulette, but not all of them are created equal. Some bets offer better odds than others, so it pays to do your research before you start playing. The best bets to make are inside bets, as they have better odds than outside bets. So focus on making Straight Up, Split, Street or Corner bets rather than Outside Bets.

2. Know when to quit 
It’s important to know when to quit while you’re ahead. If you start winning consistently, don’t get overconfident and continue betting until you lose everything. Quitting while you’re ahead is crucial if you want to walk away a winner!

3. Stay calm and focused 
Roulette is a game of chance, so there’s no guarantee that you will win every time you play. However, if you stay calm and focused, you stand a better chance of winning more often than not. Don’t let the excitement of the table get the better of you – focus on your strategy and don’t let emotions cloud your judgement.
