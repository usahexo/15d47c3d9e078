#  How to Opt Out of Facebook's Colossus Fracpot Game 

Facebook has come under fire in the past for manipulating its users’ news feeds. It has been revealed that the social media platform has been conducting psychological experiments on its users, including altering the number of positive or negative posts they saw in their feed.

Now, Facebook is at it again. This time, it is meddling with users’ emotions by playing a game called Colossus Fracpot.

The aim of Colossus Fracpot is to get Facebook users to share as much information about themselves as possible. The more information you share, the more points you earn. But there is a catch. The data you share is not just used to track your movements and activities on Facebook, it is also sold to third-party companies.

In other words, by playing Colossus Fracpot, you are not just giving Facebook more data about yourself, you are also giving away your personal information to third-party companies. And there is no way to opt out of this game.

If you do not want Facebook to manipulate your emotions and sell your personal information to third-party companies, there is only one thing you can do – delete your Facebook account.

#  How to Keep from Getting Caught up in Facebook's Gaming Frenzy 

A recent study found that the average person spends about 50 minutes per day on Facebook. While that may not seem like a lot, it adds up over time and can be hard to break once you're caught up in it. This is especially true when it comes to Facebook's gaming feature, which can be addictive and time-consuming. Here are a few tips for how to keep from getting caught up in Facebook's gaming frenzy:

1. Set a limit for yourself on how much time you're allowed to spend on Facebook each day. This can help you stay mindful of how much time you're spending on the site and avoid getting carried away.

2. Be honest with yourself about whether or not you're addicted to Facebook's gaming feature. If you find yourself spending more time than you intended on the site, it might be time to cut back.

3. Try deleting the Facebook app from your phone or computer. This can help reduce your temptation to log in and play games when you have spare time.

4. Find other activities to do instead of playing games on Facebook. This could include reading, going for walks, hanging out with friends, or participating in other hobbies or activities.

5. Talk to someone if you feel like you're struggling with Facebook's gaming feature. A therapist or counselor could help you address any underlying issues that might be contributing to your addiction.

#  How to Avoid the Colossus Fracpot Game Trap on Facebook

In the early days of Facebook, games like Farmville and Mafia Wars were all the rage. Users would spend hours each day playing these games and interacting with their friends. As the years went on, though, users began to tire of these games and quit playing them in droves.

One game that is particularly prone to this fate is Colossus Fracpot. It's a puzzle game where players have to line up four pieces of the same color in a row or column. Sounds simple enough, right?

But as players progress through the levels, the boards get more and more complex, making it increasingly difficult to line up the pieces correctly. And if you happen to click on one of the pieces by accident, it will automatically rotate, throwing off your entire strategy.

Most people who play Colossus Fracpot quickly become frustrated and give up. They then go on to play other games on Facebook that are more enjoyable and less frustrating. As a result, the developers of Colossus Fracpot have seen their user base dwindle over time.

If you're one of the unfortunate users who has become addicted to Colossus Fracpot, there are a few things you can do to avoid falling into the game trap:

1) Set a time limit for yourself. Decide how long you're going to play for each day and stick to it.
2) Don't obsess over winning. It's okay if you lose occasionally; just focus on having fun.
3) Take breaks often. Get up from your computer chair and move around for a few minutes every hour or so. This will help prevent you from getting too frustrated with the game.
4) Ask your friends for help. If you're stuck on a level, ask them for advice on how to beat it.
