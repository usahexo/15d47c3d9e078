#  Taxman cometh for Lakers bettors

The Lakers have been one of the worst teams in the NBA this season, and their poor play has cost many bettors a lot of money.

Those who wagered on the Lakers to win the championship at the beginning of the season are now facing a huge tax bill. The California Franchise Tax Board has announced that it will be looking into bets placed on the Lakers, and anyone who wagered on them to win will need to pay taxes on their winnings.

This is bad news for Lakers fans, who were hoping to see their team turn things around this season. Unfortunately, it looks like they will continue to struggle, and those who wagered on them will have to pay a big price.

#  Kobe and the taxman: how much do you have to win?

Kobe Bryant’s recently-concluded career provides a case study in the high tax rates faced by top athletes.

Bryant earned over $328 million in salary and endorsements over his 20-year career. He paid over $217 million in taxes – more than two-thirds of his earnings!

His peak income years came with the Los Angeles Lakers, during which he earned an average of over $30 million per year. Most of this income was taxed at California’s top rate of 13.3%. This means that, after federal and state taxes, Kobe took home just over half of what he earned.

Income tax rates have come down since Kobe’s peak earning years, but they are still much higher than the rates faced by many middle-class taxpayers. The top tax rate in California is now 12.3%, and the top federal rate is 37%. This means that, even after federal and state taxes, Kobe would have taken home about two-thirds of his income.

Athletes like Kobe face a high tax burden because their income is so variable and unpredictable. Many athletes earn most of their income in a few short years, while they are in the prime of their careers. This makes it difficult for them to plan for retirement, or to save for other long-term goals.

The good news is that there are ways to reduce your tax bill. Athletes can invest in deferred compensation plans, which allow them to postpone taxation on their income until they retire. They can also take advantage of special deductions and credits that are available to them.

In the end, though, athletes like Kobe have to pay a lot of taxes. This is largely because our tax system is designed to make sure that those who earn the most pay their fair share.

#  Pay up, Lakers fans: you owe taxes on your bets

The Lakers may have had an unsuccessful season this year, but many of their fans still walked away with some money in their pocket. That’s because, just like any other form of gambling, betting on the Lakers is taxable income.

Whether you won or lost your bet, as a Lakers fan, you are responsible for reporting that money to the IRS. If you didn’t already know this, now is the time to start planning for tax season.

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you file your taxes:

-You must report any and all income from gambling, including bets on the Lakers. This includes winnings and losses.

-Gambling income is considered taxable income, no matter how much or how little you make.

-You can deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings, but only if you itemize deductions on your tax return.

-If you did not itemize deductions last year, you cannot claim any gambling losses this year.

It’s important to remember that just because you didn’t win any money doesn’t mean you don’t have to report your Lakers bets. Even if your total losses were more than your total winnings, you still have to report the entire amount as income.

#  Lakers bets cost some bettors more than they won

Following the Lakers game against Oklahoma City, a few bettors found out the hard way that betting on the Lakers can be costly. Bettors who placed bets on the Lakers to win lost more money than they would have if they had placed bets on the Thunder.

The Lakers were favored to win by 3.5 points and many bettors took this as an opportunity to make some easy money. However, the Thunder ended up winning by 7 points, costing those bettors money.

This is not the first time that this has happened either. In fact, the Lakers are 2-7 against the spread in their last 9 games. This makes them a risky bet for those who are looking to make some easy money.

Despite their recent struggles, the Lakers are still a very talented team. They have two of the best players in the NBA in LeBron James and Anthony Davis. These two players have carried the Lakers throughout most of the season.

The Lakers will need these two players to continue playing at a high level if they want to make a deep playoff run. They currently sit in third place in the Western Conference, but they are just 2 games ahead of ninth place Portland.

The playoffs are just around the corner and it will be interesting to see how the Lakers perform over the next few weeks.

#  Betting on the Lakers? Make sure you know your tax liabilities

If you’re a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, and you’re excited about the team’s prospects for the upcoming season, you may be thinking about betting on them. But before you do, make sure you understand your tax liabilities.

Here in the United States, gambling winnings are treated as taxable income. This means that if you win money betting on the Lakers, you will have to pay taxes on that money. The exact amount of tax you will have to pay will depend on your income tax bracket.

For example, if you are in the 10% tax bracket, and you win $1,000 betting on the Lakers, you will have to pay $100 in taxes. If you are in the 35% tax bracket, and you win $1,000 betting on the Lakers, you will have to pay $350 in taxes.

So if you’re planning to bet on the Lakers this season, be sure to factor in your potential tax liability!
