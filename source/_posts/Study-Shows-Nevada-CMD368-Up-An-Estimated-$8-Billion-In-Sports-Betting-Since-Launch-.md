#  Study Shows Nevada CMD368 Up An Estimated $8 Billion In Sports Betting Since Launch 

A recent study shows that Nevada’s CMD368 online sports betting market is up an estimated $8 billion since its launch. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) report also showed that the Silver State’s overall gaming industry was up 2 percent in fiscal 2018 to $25.1 billion.

The CMD368 platform, which was launched in mid-2016, allows residents and visitors to place bets on sporting events through their mobile devices. Bets can be placed on a variety of traditional and non-traditional sports, including virtual or electronic sports.

According to the NGCB report, the growth in the CMD368 market is being driven by an increase in popularity of virtual and electronic sports betting. In fiscal 2018, virtual and electronic sports accounted for $1.5 billion in bets placed through CMD368, up from $968 million in fiscal 2017.

The NGCB report also showed that the amount wagered on traditional sports such as football and basketball continues to grow. In fiscal 2018, football betting was up 8 percent to $2.7 billion, while basketball betting was up 11 percent to $1.3 billion.

Overall, casino gaming revenue was up 3 percent to $17 billion in fiscal 2018, while race and sports book revenue was up 5 percent to $8.1 billion.

#  Is Gaming the New Tax Revenue Driver for Nevada? 

In the state of Nevada, lawmakers and government officials are exploring the potential of video gaming as a new source of tax revenue. With legalized gambling and casinos already in place, officials are looking to tap into the $24.5 billion gaming industry as a way to bolster state revenues. 

Officials have been eyeing video gaming for some time as a potential new revenue stream. In 2017, the state Legislature passed a bill authorizing up to 10 percent of casino revenues from video gaming be directed to the state’s education budget. The move was seen as a way to help offset declines in traditional gambling revenues. 

Now, with casino operators looking to install new video gaming machines in their establishments, lawmakers are considering whether to increase that percentage. The Nevada Resort Association is backing an amendment that would allow 25 percent of gaming machine revenue from video slots and poker be directed to the state’s education budget. That could bring in an additional $50 million per year for schools. 

While it is still unclear if such an amendment will pass, there is growing support for it among lawmakers. And with Nevada facing a budget deficit of more than $600 million, finding new sources of revenue is critical. 

Video gaming is already big business in Nevada. There are nearly 160,000 such machines in the state, generating more than $2 billion in annual revenue. That makes Nevada one of the top states in terms of video gaming activity. 

If lawmakers approve the amendment allowing for more direct contributions from video gaming to state coffers, it could provide a significant boost to Nevada’s education system while also helping to shore up its budget shortfall.

#  More than $870 million wagered on Super Bowl alone in Nevada 

The Super Bowl is a huge event on its own, but when you add in the betting that takes place, it becomes even bigger. In Nevada alone, more than $870 million was wagered on the Super Bowl this year.

That’s a lot of money being put down on just one game. Bettors can choose from a variety of different ways to wager, including picking the winner, choosing the point spread, or betting on the total number of points scored.

There are also lots of different bets that can be made within those categories. So whether you’re someone who likes to bet conservatively or likes to go all in on a big bet, there’s something for everyone when it comes to Super Bowl betting.

Of course, not everyone is lucky enough to live in a state where sports betting is legal. But that doesn’t mean you can’t get in on the action. There are plenty of online sportsbooks that will take your bets and give you great odds on the big game.

Just be sure to do your research before placing any bets so you know which site has the best odds and which ones have bonuses and promotions that fit your needs.

#  Legalized sports gambling has breathed new life into casinos 

Casinos in Las Vegas and other gambling destinations around the world are reaping the rewards of legalized sports gambling, which has been slowly gaining acceptance in jurisdictions around the world.

The state of Nevada was the first to legalize sports betting in 1949, but it was not until the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning such gambling in 2018 that its popularity started to grow.

Since then, dozens of US states have moved to legalize some form of sports betting, and many more are expected to do so in the coming years.

This is good news for casinos, which stand to make large profits from sports betting. In Nevada, for example, casinos took in $330 million in sports bets last year, up from $265 million in 2017. The growth is even more pronounced outside of the US, with Singapore’s casinos taking in over $1.5 billion in sports bets last year.

The main beneficiaries of this growth have been casino operators like Wynn Resorts Ltd., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and MGM Resorts International, all of which have seen their stock prices rise considerably since the legalization of sports betting.

Casinos have long been seen as a declining industry due to competition from other forms of entertainment such as online gaming and streaming services like Netflix. But with legalized sports gambling providing a new stream of revenue, casinos are now enjoying a resurgence.

#  Nevada sports books see record $4.7 billion in bets

The Nevada Gaming Control Board announced Monday that sports books across the state took in a record $4.7 billion worth of bets in 2017. The figure was more than double the $2.1 billion wagered in 2007, and bettors won or lost a collective $287 million on those bets, down from the $505 million won or lost in 2007.

"It's been a little bit of a roller-coaster ride the last few years, as far as wins and losses," said Michael Lawton, senior research analyst for the gaming board. "But it's still been a profitable business for casinos."

Lawton attributed the increase to the proliferation of legal sports betting operations throughout the country, including several states that have recently legalized it following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May that struck down a federal law prohibiting such gambling.

"The market is just getting bigger," Lawton said. "There are more people betting, and they're betting more money."

Globally, sports betting generates about $261 billion in revenue each year, according to figures compiled by H2 Gambling Capital, a London-based consulting firm. That figure is expected to grow to $317 billion by 2021. More than two-thirds of that amount is bet illegally.
