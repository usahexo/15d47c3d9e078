#  What is the objective of football? 

Football, or soccer as it is popularly known in the United States, is a sport that is played by kicking a ball with the foot to score goals. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opponent.

The game is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team attempts to score by kicking the ball into the other team’s goal, which is a large net. The defending team tries to stop the ball from going into the goal by catching it or blocking it with their bodies. If a player from either team kicks the ball over the goal line and out of bounds, then their team loses possession of the ball and play stops.

The game is divided into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute break in between them. At halftime, both teams change ends of the playing field so that each team has an equal chance to attack and defend. The referee oversees play and can stop play for infringements or dangerous play. 

At the end of regulation time, if both teams are still tied, then an additional 30 minutes of play are added, consisting of two 15-minute halves. If still tied after that, then a winner is decided by penalty kicks. 

Football has been played since at least 1848, when British students at Cambridge University created it codifying various rules that they had been playing by. A set of official rules was drawn up in 1877 and has undergone many revisions over the years

#  How do footballers get paid? 

There are a variety of ways in which a professional footballer can be paid. The most common way a footballer is paid is through their salary, which is typically a set amount that is paid to them on a monthly or yearly basis. Footballers can also be paid bonuses for winning matches or scoring goals, as well as other incentives related to their performance on the pitch. Additionally, some footballers may receive sponsorship deals from companies looking to associate their brand with the sport. Finally, some footballers may also earn income through investments and other forms of income generation.

The amount of money that a footballer earns can vary greatly depending on a number of factors. The size of the club they play for, the league they play in, and their individual performances all have an impact on how much money they take home. Generally speaking, the best-paid players in the world play for top clubs in major leagues such as La Liga or the English Premier League. For example, Lionel Messi reportedly earns over £100,000 per week at Barcelona, while Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to earn over £300,000 per week at Real Madrid. In comparison, players in lower divisions or playing for smaller clubs may only earn a few thousand pounds per month.

While salary is often the main form of income for footballers, it is not always guaranteed. In fact, many footballers around the world face the risk of not being paid at all if their club goes into administration or folds altogether. This is particularly common in lower-level leagues where clubs are often run by individuals who are not necessarily experienced in managing a football club. This can lead to situations where players are not paid their wages for months on end, which can be very difficult to manage financially.
